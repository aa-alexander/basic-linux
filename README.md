Some useful **basic linux commands and shell scripts** useful for bioinformatics begginers can be found here. These are some of the commands and scripts I used in my analysis time to time.


### Fastq file Download
This is shell script to download the fastq file from ena browser. For your use see all the files in the ena browser under the **SRP**id. Change the seq in the first for loop for your use. See all the **SRR**id and take the common prefix for all the file and put the changing suffix range in the sequence. It downloads and unzips the fastq file.

The SRP id used in this script is an example from the study **PRJNA518153**
